9.	Funding: The total funding raised by the company (as a string initially).
10.	Select Investors: Key investors in the company.

# Application of DIKW:
The DIKW framework helps us systematically process the unicorn dataset to generate actionable insights. We have conducted a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis and generated the required visuals. Now we will use this structured approach to turning raw data into meaningful insights for stakeholders, helping both startups and investors strategize effectively. 
For this specific EDA report, we would apply the DIKW framework. The application of DIKW would be as follows: 
1.	Data 
2.	Analysis = Information + Knowledge
3.	Recommendations = Wise decisions based on the proper Analysis
   # You can find these on Report Document.
